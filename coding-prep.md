# Candidate Prep Guide - Coding

This document provides best practices for preparing for Data Structures & Algorithms (DS&A) interviews, along with tailored guidelines for commonly used programming languages.

## General Expectations

This interview evaluates your ability to solve problems efficiently using core data structures and algorithms. You are expected to:

## Execution & Environment Familiarity

You should be comfortable with:

* CoderPad Environment: Running code, debugging, and handling syntax quickly during timed rounds.
* Library Knowledge: Familiarity with common libraries for data structures and algorithms in your language of choice.

* Test as You Go: Continuously validate your logic with edge cases and common use cases.

## Practice & Readiness

To be fully prepared:

* Leetcode, HackerRank, CodeSignal: Regularly practice with timed coding challenges.
* Mock Interviews: Simulate real-world coding interview scenarios under time constraints.
* Refactor & Optimize: Revisit your solutions to identify areas for optimization and clarity.

## Example Coding Questions

1. **Data Structure Design:** This is a coding question where you’ll be writing code to design data structures optimized for reads and writes in the language of your choice. It’ll have nothing to do with AI/ML or complex algorithms. You’re free to Google standard library functionality during the interview. You’ll be evaluated on your problem-solving ability and ability to write clean, well-designed code.
2. **Time-Based Information Tracking:** This is a coding question where you’ll be writing code to track time-based information in the language of your choice.

It’ll have nothing to do with AI/ML or complex algorithms. You are expected to write clean, modular, and well-structured code.

3. **Syntax Processing:** This is a coding question for processing the syntax rules of a hypothetical language. It has nothing to do with AI/ML, and does not need esoteric algorithms/DS. It might help if you are familiar with the concept of a "generic type" (such as C++/Java templates).
4. **Distributed Systems Debugging:** This is a distributed systems debugging question. Think about the types of issues you'd often encounter in a production environment dealing with high scale and concurrency. You’ll be evaluated on your ability to identify problem areas, propose/implement solutions, and how well you communicate.
5. **IPv4 and CIDR Familiarity:** This coding question is asked of backend/infra engineers. It requires a bit of familiarity with IPv4 and CIDR, so if you're rusty on those concepts you may need to study up a bit.

## Coding in Specific Languages

### C++

* efficiency matters – c++ is great for low-level control and speed, but it means being more intentional with memory and execution time. optimizing data structures, minimizing unnecessary copies, and leveraging pointers where it makes sense can have a big impact.
* manual memory management – unlike python, c++ doesn’t have garbage collection, so you’ll need to handle memory allocation and deallocation yourself. smart pointers ( `std::unique_ptr` , `std::shared_ptr` ) can help prevent leaks and make code cleaner.
* standard library + tools – while python has a ton of built-ins, c++ has the STL (Standard Template Library) for things like `vector` , `map` , and `stack` . getting familiar with these can really speed up implementation.
* handling edge cases – when working with structures like lists, trees, and graphs, make sure to account for null pointers, boundary conditions, and path manipulations.
* testing + validation – c++ doesn’t have `unittest` , so it’s worth setting up quick test cases to validate edge scenarios and logic. simple `assert` statements work great here.

### Java

* memory management + garbage collection – java handles garbage collection for you, but it’s still important to watch for memory leaks (e.g., holding onto references longer than needed).
* object-oriented structure – java is heavily object-oriented, so consider how you can break down your solution into classes and objects that are clean and modular.
* collections framework – get familiar with the Collections library ( `ArrayList` , `HashMap` , `HashSet` , `LinkedList` ). knowing when to use which structure is key.
* multi-threading + synchronization – java makes it easy to work with threads, but you need to watch out for concurrency issues. understanding `synchronized` , `volatile` , and `ConcurrentHashMap` can be a plus.
* testing + validation – java has `JUnit` , which makes it super easy to write unit tests and validate edge cases. definitely worth getting comfortable with that.

### JavaScript

* asynchronous operations – js is single-threaded but async by nature, so understanding callbacks, promises, and `async/await` is important for performance.
* prototype-based inheritance – js handles inheritance differently than class-based languages. get familiar with prototypes and how inheritance is managed.
* collections + iteration – js has strong support for objects and arrays, but be mindful of performance with large data sets. methods like `.map()` , `.filter()` , and `.reduce()` are powerful.

* edge cases + type coercion – js is loosely typed, so `==` vs `===` matters. be conscious of implicit type coercion and null/undefined checks.
* testing + validation – you can use Mocha or Jest for quick unit tests. testing for async behavior and edge cases is key.

### Go

* goroutines + concurrency – go is built with concurrency in mind, so understanding `goroutines` , `channels` , and synchronization ( `sync.WaitGroup` ) is key.
* memory management – go has garbage collection, but you still need to be mindful of memory usage, especially with large structs or arrays.
* error handling – unlike python’s exceptions, go uses explicit error handling, so you’ll need to be comfortable with checking and returning errors frequently.
* standard library + tools – go’s standard library is super powerful; things like `http` , `json` , and `sync` are heavily optimized.
* testing + validation – go has its own testing package ( `testing` ) built in, and running tests is as simple as `go test` .

### Rust

* ownership + borrowing – rust’s memory model is based on ownership and borrowing instead of garbage collection, so understanding the borrow checker is crucial.
* error handling – rust handles errors with `Result` and `Option` types instead of exceptions. get familiar with the `?` operator and pattern matching for clean error management.
* collections + iterators – rust’s `Vec` , `HashMap` , and `Option` are the go-to for DS&A. mastering the iterator pattern will help with performance and readability.
* concurrency + safety – rust is memory-safe even in multi-threaded contexts, but you still need to understand how to handle locks and synchronization properly.
* testing + validation – rust has built-in testing support with `cargo test` . it’s worth building out edge cases to validate your logic.
